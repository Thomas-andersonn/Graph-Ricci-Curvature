# Graph-Ricci-Curvature
In this project we calculate ricci curvature at each node of a graph and scalar curvature of the entire graph.

How to run the project:
1. Compile the ricci curvature.cpp
2. Execute the executable

Input:</br>
We are generating random graphs and taking the random graph as input. The adjacency matrix for the graph can be seen in inputGraph.txt. And the input graph has been visualized in inputGraph.png

Intermediary:
The all pair shortest path for the shortest graph is stored in apsp.csv. And the hop distance is stored in apsh.csv. 

Output:
The Ricci curvature at each node is stored in Ricci_Curvature.txt along with the scalar curvature of the entire graph.
